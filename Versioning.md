## Version Format

## The rule for build and revision number

The build number is the number of days since November 6, 2022 because the first
version of Mile.Windows.Helpers is created and published on that day.

The revision number is the number of releases releases in the day corresponding
to the build number, and it counts from zero. So the first revision is 0 and 
the second revision is 1.
